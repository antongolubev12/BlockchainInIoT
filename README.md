# Blockchain In IoT

IoT has the potential to transform the world by making everything interconnected through small devices that are connected to
one massive network. However, it has some problems such as scalability, cost and security that will need to be resolved before it
achieves this goal. Blockchain is another potentially world changing technology and could potentially be the silver bullet needed to fix the issues in IoT.  
In this literature review, I review the problems with IoT and how blockchain technology could potentially solve them.
